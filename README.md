# Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

   This repository with deal with the application of k-nn Algorithm to diagnose breast cancer. The following process has been adapted from Brett Lantz, "Machine Learning With R". The following process will adapt to using the nearest neighbor algorithm to correctly attempt predict whether the patients had a benign or malignant tumor.
