# Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

   This repository with deal with the application of k-nn Algorithm to diagnose breast cancer using R. I have been greatly inspired by Brett Lantz and adapted many of his styles of learning methods from the book, "Machine Learning With R".
   
  This will be a repository of the application of the k-NN algorithm to any previous datasets I have processed.
   
   Please note that this repository may not give you the full insight to theory or understanding of the algorithm itself, but how to apply it with R.
